Since tiempo uses the Twisted reactor for scheduling, it makes good sense to use the Twisted [Trial](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/testing.html) tool for testing.  As always then using Trial, it's important when testing tiempo applications to remember to "leave the reactor" as you found it.
 
 In this case, that means cleaning the RUNNERS and TIEMPO_REGISTRY singletons in tiempo.__init__.  Otherwise, you risk running subsequent tests with a polluted state.
